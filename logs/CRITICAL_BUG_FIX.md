# 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Market DD Notebook

**Date**: October 11, 2025 at 4:11am  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## 🐛 **Bug Discovered:**

The market DD notebook (`dd_pd_market.ipynb`) was **recalculating sigma_E from rolling rit** using the OLD method, and **overwriting** the correctly merged values from `equity_volatility_by_year.csv`.

---

## 📊 **Evidence:**

Looking at JPM 2018 output:
```
equity_volatility: 0.2068 (20.68%)  ← CORRECT from equity_volatility_by_year.csv
equity_vol:        0.0117 (1.17%)   ← WRONG! Calculated from 3-year rolling rit
DD_m:              35.0             ← Capped because sigma is artificially low
```

**Result**: All 2018 DD values were artificially high (capped at 35.0) because sigma_E was being recalculated to be ~1% instead of the correct ~20%.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The notebook had a cell (originally at index 13) that contained:

```python
def rolling_sigma_prior(s):
    """Compute rolling std using only prior data (shift(1))."""
    return s.shift(1).rolling(3, min_periods=2).std()

# Compute sigma_E using returns up to t-1 only
df['sigma_E_tminus1'] = df.groupby('instrument', group_keys=False)['rit'].apply(rolling_sigma_prior)

# Use sigma_E_tminus1 for solver (replace equity_vol if it exists)
df['equity_vol'] = df['sigma_E_tminus1']  # ← THIS LINE OVERWROTE CORRECT VALUES!
```

This cell was:
1. ✅ Creating window provenance columns (needed)
2. ✅ Creating time-tagged columns (needed)
3. ❌ **Recalculating sigma_E from rit** (OLD method - wrong!)
4. ❌ **Overwriting `equity_vol`** with the recalculated value

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **Step 1: Remove OLD calculation**
- **Deleted** the cell that was recalculating sigma_E from rolling rit
- **Script**: `scripts/fix_market_notebook_sigma.py`

### **Step 2: Add back provenance columns**
- Merge `sigma_E_method` and `sigma_E_window_months` from equity_vol DataFrame
- Calculate window years properly: `sigmaE_window_start_year`, `sigmaE_window_end_year`
- **Script**: `scripts/fix_market_notebook_v2.py`

### **Step 3: Add back time-tagged columns**
- Create `E_t` = market_cap (current year equity value)
- Create `F_t` = F (face value of debt)
- Create `rf_t` = rf (risk-free rate)
- Create `sigma_E_tminus1` = equity_volatility (already at t-1 from file)
- **Script**: `scripts/fix_market_notebook_v3.py` (final complete version)

---

## 📝 **Final Implementation:**

The corrected cell now contains:

```python
# 5.7 Add sigma_E provenance columns from merged equity volatility
provenance_cols = ['ticker_prefix', 'year', 'sigma_E_method', 'sigma_E_window_months']
vol_provenance = equity_vol[provenance_cols].copy()
df = df.merge(vol_provenance, on=['ticker_prefix', 'year'], how='left')

# Calculate window years
df['sigmaE_window_end_year'] = df['year'] - 1
df['sigmaE_window_start_year'] = df['sigmaE_window_end_year'] - (df['sigma_E_window_months'] / 12 - 1).clip(lower=0).astype(int)

# 5.8 Create time-tagged columns
df['E_t'] = df['market_cap']
df['F_t'] = df['F']
df['rf_t'] = df['rf']
df['T'] = 1.0
df['sigma_E_tminus1'] = df['equity_volatility']  # Already at t-1 from file!
```

**Key change**: `sigma_E_tminus1` now directly uses `equity_volatility` from the merged file instead of recalculating it!

---

## 🎯 **Expected Impact:**

### **Before Fix:**
```
JPM 2018:
  sigma_E: ~0.01 (1%)      ← Recalculated from rolling rit
  DD_m: 35.0               ← Capped
```

### **After Fix:**
```
JPM 2018:
  sigma_E: 0.2068 (20.68%) ← From equity_volatility_by_year.csv
  DD_m: ~12-14             ← Realistic value
```

**Improvement**: ~40% increase in sigma_E → ~60% decrease in DD (from capped 35 to realistic 12-14)

---

## ⚠️ **MUST RE-RUN NOTEBOOKS:**

1. ✅ **Market DD fixed** - Re-run `dd_pd_market.ipynb`
2. ✅ **Accounting DD** - Should already be correct (was patched earlier)
3. ✅ **Merging** - Re-run `merging.ipynb` to combine corrected results
4. ✅ **Validation** - Re-run validation script to verify improvements

---

## 📋 **Verification Checklist:**

After re-running market DD notebook, check:

- [ ] `equity_vol` column matches `equity_volatility` column (both ~20% for 2018)
- [ ] `sigma_E_tminus1` column matches `equity_volatility` column
- [ ] 2018 DD_m values are in range 10-16 (not capped at 35.0)
- [ ] No KeyError for `rf_t`, `E_t`, `F_t`, `sigmaE_window_end_year`
- [ ] Time integrity assertions pass
- [ ] Solver convergence rates high (>90%)

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Restart kernel** in `dd_pd_market.ipynb`
2. **Run all cells** (Cell → Run All)
3. **Verify** 2018 DD values are realistic
4. **Re-run** `dd_pd_accounting.ipynb` (should already work)
5. **Re-run** `merging.ipynb`
6. **Re-run** validation script
7. **Proceed** to Instruction 4 (paper update)

---

## 📊 **Why This Matters:**

This was the **root cause** of the "2018 anomaly" - not a data issue, but a code issue where the notebook was using the wrong sigma_E calculation method!

The new equity volatility file with improved 2018 coverage was being loaded correctly, but then immediately overwritten by the old calculation method.

**Status**: Bug identified and fixed. Notebooks ready for re-execution.
