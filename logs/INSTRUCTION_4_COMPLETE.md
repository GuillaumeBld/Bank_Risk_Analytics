## 📋 **CONTENT SUMMARY**

### **1. Data Sources Table** ✅

| Component | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| Total Returns | CRSP, 2013-2023 |
| Market Data | Bloomberg, CRSP |
| Accounting Data | Compustat, S&P Capital IQ |
| Risk-Free Rate | Federal Reserve |
| Coverage | 1,311 bank-year observations |

---

### **2. Equity Volatility Calculation** ✅

**Hierarchical Three-Method Approach:**

#### **Primary Method (98.2% coverage)**
```
σ_{E,t-1} = √12 × std(r_{t-36:t-1})
```
- 36-month rolling window
- Minimum 9 valid returns required
- 1,287/1,311 observations

#### **Fallback 1: EWMA (1.5% coverage)**
```
σ²_t = λ × σ²_{t-1} + (1-λ) × r²_t
```
- λ = 0.94 (RiskMetrics standard)
- Used when <36 months available
- 20/1,311 observations

#### **Fallback 2: Peer Median (0.3% coverage)**
- Size-based peer groups
- Used when <12 months available
- 4/1,311 observations
