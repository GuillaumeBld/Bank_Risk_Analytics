### Backup Everything

```bash
# Create git branch
cd /path/to/risk_bank
git checkout -b feature/daily-volatility
git status  # Verify clean state

2. Open `dd_pd_accounting.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Find Section 5
4. Replace with new code (copy-paste from guide)
5. Run entire notebook

**Verification**:
- [ ] Notebook runs without errors
- [ ] Section 5 completes successfully
- [ ] Volatility loaded and merged
- [ ] Plots generated
- [ ] DD/PD values calculated
- [ ] Output file created

**Stop if**: Notebook crashes or produces errors

---

## üìì Phase 5: Update Market Notebook (1 hour)

### Follow the Guide

1. Open `03_NOTEBOOK_MARKET_CHANGES.md`
2. Open `dd_pd_market.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Find Section 5
4. Replace with new code (copy-paste from guide)
5. Run entire notebook

**Verification**:
- [ ] Notebook runs without errors
- [ ] Section 5 completes successfully
- [ ] Volatility loaded and merged
- [ ] Solver converges
- [ ] Output file created

**Stop if**: Solver fails or produces bad results

---

## üìä Phase 6: Compare Results (30 min)

### Run Comparison

```bash
python 07_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.py
```

**Review Outputs**:
- `data/outputs/analysis/volatility_comparison_analysis.png`
- `data/outputs/analysis/migration_summary_report.txt`

- [ ] Comparison analysis ran
- [ ] Correlation ‚â•0.60
- [ ] Changes look reasonable
- [ ] Visualizations make sense
- [ ] Summary report reviewed

**Stop if**: Results look completely wrong

---

## üìù Phase 7: Update Documentation (2 hours)

### Update Files

1. Open `04_DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES.md`
2. Update `docs/writing/dd_and_pd.md`
   - [ ] Methodology section updated
   - [ ] Data table updated
   - [ ] References added
   - [ ] All "3-year" removed

3. Update `docs/guides/EQUITY_VOLATILITY_EXPLANATION.md`
   - [ ] Formula updated
   - [ ] Window description changed

4. Update `README.md`
   - [ ] Methodology section added

**Stop if**: You're unsure about changes

---

## üéØ Phase 8: Final Validation (1 hour)

### Complete System Test

```bash
# Re-run both notebooks from scratch
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute dd_pd_accounting.ipynb
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute dd_pd_market.ipynb

# Verify outputs exist
ls -lh data/outputs/datasheet/*DAILY*.csv
ls -lh data/outputs/analysis/*.png
```

- [ ] Accounting notebook runs end-to-end
- [ ] Market notebook runs end-to-end
- [ ] Output files created with _DAILY suffix
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Results look reasonable

**Stop if**: Either notebook fails
