   - Generates visualizations comparing old vs new method
   - Provides validation that changes are reasonable
   - Creates summary report for paper

2. **Phase 8: Full System Validation** (2-3 hours)
   - **CRITICAL**: Must test both notebooks end-to-end
   - Verify DD/PD calculations work correctly
   - Ensure no NaN propagation from missing data
   - Validate filtering is working as intended

3. **Phase 9: Commit & Push** (30 min)
   - Only after Phase 8 confirms everything works
   - Create comprehensive commit message
   - Push to remote repository

4. **Phase 10: Cleanup** (30 min)
   - Final housekeeping
   - Archive old files
   - Update documentation

## üìã CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Data Quality Filter ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Drop all bank-years without complete volatility  
**Rationale**: Better to exclude than calculate DD/PD with missing inputs  
**Impact**: 134 observations excluded (6.9%), final sample 1,821  

### 2. Paper Disclosure ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Full transparent disclosure of coverage and exclusions  
**Rationale**: Builds confidence in methodology  
**Implementation**: Template created in `DATA_COVERAGE_DISCLOSURE.md`

### 3. Early Year Coverage ‚úÖ
**Decision**: Accept 84-90% coverage for 2016-2018  
**Rationale**: Overall 93.1% exceeds target, all major banks covered, recent years >95%  
**Impact**: Acknowledged in paper with explanation

---

## üìÅ NEW FILES CREATED

1. `data/clean/equity_volatility_by_year_DAILY.csv` (1,955 rows)
2. `data/clean/volatility_diagnostic_DAILY.csv` (diagnostic summary)
3. `migration_to_daily_volatility/ADDENDUM_DATA_QUALITY_FILTERING.md`
4. `migration_to_daily_volatility/MIGRATION_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` (this file)
5. `docs/writing/DATA_COVERAGE_DISCLOSURE.md`
6. `MIGRATION_START_TIME.txt` (timestamp)

---

## üîç FILES MODIFIED

1. `dd_pd_accounting.ipynb` - Section 5 updated
2. `dd_pd_market.ipynb` - Section 5 updated
3. `docs/writing/dd_and_pd.md` - Multiple sections updated

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Notebooks NOT yet tested end-to-end**: Phase 8 is critical
2. **Old volatility file still present**: Will archive in Phase 10
3. **Comparison analysis pending**: Will validate changes are reasonable
4. **Git branch active**: `feature/daily-volatility` (not yet pushed)

---

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Early year data availability**: Lower coverage in 2016-2018 expected, acceptable
2. **Strict filtering improves quality**: Better to exclude than propagate NaNs
3. **Transparent disclosure critical**: Full coverage table builds confidence
4. **Daily > Monthly**: Captures intra-period volatility, aligns with literature

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR PHASE 7 (Comparison Analysis)**

**Estimated remaining time**: 3-4 hours to complete migration

**Next command**: 
```bash
cd migration_to_daily_volatility
python3 07_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.py
```
