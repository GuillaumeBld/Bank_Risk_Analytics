# <goal>
Build a report that answers the following interrogations:

> “We seem to have a negative DDm value for a bank. Any explanation? Also, I need to get the detailed calculation of the DD and PD. From what I remember, the standard deviation of equity was calculated based on the last 12 months of equity prices, or rates of return. Which one? Could we have an estimate based on 24 months?”

[2025-07-18 15:00 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Initial project exploration to locate relevant notebooks and data files. Next: Analyze the content of the most relevant files found.
[2025-07-18 15:05 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Analyzed notebooks, identified a KeyError in the accounting notebook and confirmed the negative DDm value. Next: Create a new notebook in the diagnostic directory to debug the KeyError in `dd_pd_accounting.ipynb`.
[2025-07-18 15:10 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Created `diag_20250718_debug_accounting_dd.ipynb` with relevant code and added print statements to debug the KeyError. Next: Execute the diagnostic notebook to identify the missing column.
[2025-07-18 15:15 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Jupyter command not found. Created `diag_20250718_debug_accounting_dd.py` with relevant code and debug print. Next: Execute the Python script to identify the missing column.
[2025-07-18 15:20 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Executed debug script, but KeyError was not reproduced. Modifying script to add more robust checks for 'equity_vol' column presence and nulls, and specific KeyError handling. Next: Re-execute the modified Python script.
[2025-07-18 15:25 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Executed modified debug script successfully; KeyError not reproduced. Proceeding to explain negative DDm values. Next: Explain negative DDm values and investigate equity volatility calculation.
[2025-07-18 15:30 UTC][Agent 3] Action: Explained negative DDm values. Attempted to locate the script generating `equity_volatility_by_year.csv` but failed. Next: Broaden search for Python files containing "volatility" and "to_csv" across the entire project.
