# <goal>
Build a report that answers the following interrogations:

> “We seem to have a negative DDm value for a bank. Any explanation? Also, I need to get the detailed calculation of the DD and PD. From what I remember, the standard deviation of equity was calculated based on the last 12 months of equity prices, or rates of return. Which one? Could we have an estimate based on 24 months?”
