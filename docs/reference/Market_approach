# Market-approach, Merton KMV, solver

Purpose

Estimate Distance to Default (DDm) and market implied default probability (PDm) by solving the Merton system for asset value V and asset volatility \sigma_V using observed equity E and equity volatility \sigma_E.

Inputs

Minimum columns per row:
	•	instrument, year
	•	market_cap → equity value E in USD
	•	equity_vol → \sigma_E annualized, decimal
	•	debt_total_usd or configured barrier F in USD
	•	rf → one year risk free rate r_f decimal
	•	T → horizon in years, default 1.0

Conventions
	•	Default barrier F is configurable.
Option A (default): F = \texttt{debt_total_usd}.
Option B: F = \texttt{short_term_debt\_usd} + 0.5 \times \texttt{long_term_debt\_usd}.
The notebook must print the active convention at run time.
	•	DDm uses \mu = r_f in the numerator.

Core equations

Pricing and leverage sensitivity:
E = V\,\Phi(d_1) - F\,e^{-r_f T}\,\Phi(d_2),
\quad
\sigma_E = \frac{V}{E}\,\Phi(d_1)\,\sigma_V,
d_1 = \frac{\ln\!\left(\tfrac{V}{F}\right) + \left(r_f + \tfrac12\sigma_V^2\right)T}{\sigma_V\sqrt{T}},
\quad
d_2 = d_1 - \sigma_V\sqrt{T}.
Distance to default and probability:
\mathrm{DDm} = \frac{\ln\!\left(\tfrac{V}{F}\right) + \left(r_f - \tfrac12\sigma_V^2\right)T}{\sigma_V\sqrt{T}},
\quad
\mathrm{PDm} = \Phi(-\mathrm{DDm}).

Solver
	•	Unknowns: x = (V,\sigma_V) with bounds V>F, \sigma_V>0.
	•	Residual vector R(x):
	•	Price residual: R_1 = E_{\text{model}}(V,\sigma_V) - E_{\text{obs}}.
	•	Vol residual: R_2 = \sigma_{E,\text{model}}(V,\sigma_V) - \sigma_{E,\text{obs}}.
	•	Use a robust root finder (for example SciPy root or least_squares) with scaling.
	•	Initial guess:
	•	V_0 = E + F
	•	\sigma_{V,0} = \min(\sigma_E, 1.0)

Required logging

Write these columns for every row, regardless of convergence:
	•	instrument, year, E, sigma_E, F, rf, T
	•	V, sigma_V (NaN if not converged)
	•	d1, d2 (NaN if not converged)
	•	price_implied, vol_implied
	•	resid_price = price_implied - E
	•	resid_vol = vol_implied - sigma_E
	•	solver_status in {converged, no_debt, invalid_inputs, no_converge}
	•	solver_message from the optimizer
	•	iterations, function_evals
	•	DDm, PDm (NaN if not converged)

Convergence rule
	•	Mark converged if |\texttt{resid_price}| \le \tau_E and |\texttt{resid_vol}| \le \tau_\sigma.
Defaults: \tau_E = 1\text{e-}6 \times \max(1, E), \tau_\sigma = 1\text{e-}4.
	•	Keep only converged rows for summaries and plots.

Input screening

Skip and set solver_status accordingly when:
	•	F <= 0 or E <= 0 or sigma_E <= 0 or T <= 0 → invalid_inputs
	•	debt_total_usd == 0 under active barrier convention → no_debt
	•	Any NaN in required fields → invalid_inputs

Output files
	•	dd_pd_market.csv with all logging columns above.
	•	dd_pd_market_summary.csv with count, min, p10, p25, median, p75, p90, max of DDm and PDm, by year and overall.

Notebook structure
	1.	Title cell stating: Market approach, Merton KMV solve. Uses \mu = r_f. Barrier convention printed.
	2.	Parameters cell: tolerances, max iterations, barrier option, random seed.
	3.	Input audit: presence and units, counts by year.
	4.	Compute F per convention and echo choice.
	5.	Solve loop with vectorized apply or batched solver. Persist raw residuals and metadata.
	6.	Compute DDm and PDm only for converged.
	7.	Save outputs. Print convergence rate and residual quantiles.
	8.	Plots: histogram of DDm, scatter of resid_price vs resid_vol for diagnostics.

Assertions
	•	Assert that all kept rows have solver_status == "converged".
	•	Assert that DDm equals the formula with \mu=r_f within 1\text{e-}8.
	•	Assert F equals the active convention for at least 99 percent of rows.

Pseudocode

def merton_residuals(v_sigma, E_obs, sigmaE_obs, F, rf, T):
    V, sigmaV = v_sigma
    if V <= F or sigmaV <= 0: return np.array([np.inf, np.inf])
    d1 = (np.log(V/F) + (rf + 0.5*sigmaV**2)*T) / (sigmaV*np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigmaV*np.sqrt(T)
    E_model = V*Phi(d1) - F*np.exp(-rf*T)*Phi(d2)
    sigmaE_model = (V/E_model)*Phi(d1)*sigmaV
    return np.array([E_model - E_obs, sigmaE_model - sigmaE_obs])

Code comments to add
	•	At DD computation, comment explicitly:
# DDm uses mu = rf by construction of risk neutral pricing
	•	At barrier construction, comment:
# F convention: using total debt in USD (Option A). Change via config if needed.

Acceptance checks for CI
	•	Convergence rate printed and greater than a set floor, for example 80 percent on the shipped demo dataset.
	•	Median absolute resid_price and resid_vol among converged less than tolerances.
	•	No row in outputs has converged with NaN V or sigma_V.
