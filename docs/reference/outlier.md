# Distance-to-Default Outliers (>13)

This document catalogs the bank-year combinations that produced distance-to-default (DD) scores above 13 in the accounting- and market-based datasets investigated earlier. Entries are grouped by the key conditions that drive these extreme results—namely zero-cost debt inputs, negligible recorded debt, and very low leverage (debt-to-equity ratio ≤ 5%).
