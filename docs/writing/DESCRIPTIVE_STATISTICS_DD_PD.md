**Notes**:
- DD_a: Distance-to-Default (Accounting approach, Bharath & Shumway naive method)
- DD_m: Distance-to-Default (Market approach, Merton model with iterative solver)
- PD_a: Probability of Default (Accounting approach) = Φ(-DD_a)
- PD_m: Probability of Default (Market approach) = Φ(-DD_m)
- Higher DD indicates lower default risk; Lower PD indicates lower default probability

**Notes**:
- N: Number of bank-year observations with valid DD/PD calculations
- **2021 anomaly**: Significantly lower DD (higher risk) - likely due to data quality issues, under investigation
- **2020 (COVID-19)**: Highest DD observed (14.49), indicating resilience despite pandemic
- **2018**: Market volatility from Fed tightening reflected in elevated PD_m
- Trend: Generally stable DD across years except 2021 outlier

**Key Observations**:
1. **Pre-COVID (2016-2019)**: DD_a ranged 12.70-13.68, stable risk profile
2. **COVID year (2020)**: DD increased to 14.49 (lower risk), possibly due to government support
3. **2021**: Sharp decline in DD (5.36) - **requires investigation**
4. **Post-COVID (2022-2023)**: DD recovered to 11.69-11.92, normalizing risk

## Table 3: Descriptive Statistics by Bank Size

| Size | N | DD_a Mean | DD_a Median | DD_m Mean | DD_m Median | PD_a Mean | PD_m Mean |
|------|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Large** | 32 | 9.19 | 9.58 | 4.91 | 5.11 | 0.000021 | 0.002177 |
| **Mid** | 64 | 10.73 | 10.60 | 5.93 | 5.88 | 0.000013 | 0.001478 |
| **Small** | 1,328 | 11.93 | 11.40 | 7.06 | 6.48 | 0.000915 | 0.001490 |

**Notes**:
- **Size Classification**:
  - Large banks: dummylarge = 1 (typically assets > $100B)
  - Mid banks: dummymid = 1 (typically assets $10B-$100B)
  - Small banks: All others (typically assets < $10B)
- **Counterintuitive finding**: Larger banks show LOWER DD (higher risk)
  - This contradicts "too big to fail" hypothesis
  - Possible explanations:
    1. Higher leverage ratios in large banks
    2. More complex risk profiles captured by market
    3. Different risk-taking behavior
    4. Sample composition effects
- **PD pattern**: Large banks have higher PD_m (0.002177 vs 0.001490 for small)

## Table 4: Correlation Matrix

|  | DD_a | DD_m | PD_a | PD_m |
|---|------|------|------|------|
| **DD_a** | 1.000 | 0.950 | -0.094 | -0.274 |
| **DD_m** | 0.950 | 1.000 | -0.015 | -0.244 |
| **PD_a** | -0.094 | -0.015 | 1.000 | 0.053 |
| **PD_m** | -0.274 | -0.244 | 0.053 | 1.000 |

**Key Findings**:
1. **DD_a and DD_m: Very high positive correlation (0.950)**
   - Both approaches produce highly consistent default distance measures
   - Validates both methodologies
   - Accounting and market approaches capture similar underlying risk

2. **DD and PD: Negative correlation (as expected)**
   - DD_a vs PD_m: -0.274 (moderate negative)
   - DD_m vs PD_m: -0.244 (moderate negative)
   - DD_a vs PD_a: -0.094 (weak negative) - **interesting**
   - Lower magnitude than expected, possibly due to:
     - PD values concentrated near zero (most banks very safe)
     - Non-linear transformation Φ(-DD) compresses relationship
     - Extreme DD values have minimal impact on already-tiny PDs

3. **PD_a and PD_m: Low positive correlation (0.053)**
   - Weak relationship between accounting and market-based default probabilities
   - Suggests different information captured by each approach
   - Accounting PD based on book values and historical volatility
   - Market PD incorporates forward-looking market expectations

## Summary Statistics for Paper

### For Methods Section:

> "We calculate distance-to-default using both accounting (DD_a) and market (DD_m) approaches following Merton (1974) and Bharath & Shumway (2008). Equity volatility is estimated from daily returns using a 252-day rolling window. Our final sample includes 1,424 bank-year observations from 2016-2023, with 1,343 observations having valid DD_a values (94.3% coverage) and 1,341 having valid DD_m values (94.2% coverage)."

### For Results Section:

> "Table X presents descriptive statistics for our default risk measures. Mean distance-to-default is 11.81 for the accounting approach and 6.96 for the market approach, indicating substantial buffers against default. The corresponding mean default probabilities are negligible (0.09% and 0.15%, respectively), consistent with the heavily regulated and well-capitalized nature of the U.S. banking sector. The high correlation between DD_a and DD_m (0.950) validates the consistency of both methodologies."

> "Panel B shows variation across years. Default risk remained relatively stable during 2016-2019 (DD_a: 12.70-13.68). During the COVID-19 pandemic year (2020), DD increased to 14.49, suggesting banks maintained strong capital buffers despite economic disruption, possibly aided by regulatory forbearance and government support programs. Risk metrics returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2022-2023."

> "Panel C reveals an unexpected pattern by bank size: larger banks exhibit lower distance-to-default (DD_a: 9.19 for large vs 11.93 for small), suggesting higher default risk. This contrasts with conventional 'too big to fail' expectations and may reflect higher leverage ratios, more complex risk profiles, or different risk-taking behavior in large institutions."

## Key Insights for Discussion

### 1. Daily Volatility Impact
Using daily returns (252-day window) instead of monthly returns (36-month window):
- Captures intra-period volatility dynamics more accurately
- Especially important during crisis periods (2020, 2021)
- Mean equity volatility: 31.7% (daily) vs 27.0% (monthly), a 17% increase
- This higher volatility feeds into DD calculations, potentially making them more conservative

### 2. Accounting vs Market Approach
- **DD_a > DD_m**: Accounting approach yields higher DD (11.81 vs 6.96)
  - Book values typically more stable than market values
  - Accounting approach less sensitive to market sentiment
  - Market approach incorporates forward-looking information
- **High correlation (0.950)**: Both capture similar underlying default risk
- **Different PD patterns**: PD_m shows more variation across banks/time

### 3. Temporal Patterns
- **2016-2019**: Stable period, consistent risk metrics
- **2020**: COVID resilience, DD increased (lower risk)
- **2021**: Anomalous low DD - **data quality issue suspected**
- **2022-2023**: Return to normal, stable risk profile

### 4. Size Effects
- **Counterintuitive**: Large banks riskier than small
- Possible explanations require further investigation:
  - Regulatory arbitrage?
  - Different business models?
  - Market discipline effects?
  - Sample selection?

## Data Quality Notes

### Coverage
- Overall: 94.3% (DD_a), 94.2% (DD_m)
- Missing observations due to:
  - Incomplete daily volatility data (6.9% excluded at raw level)
  - ESG data merge limitations
  - Additional notebook filters (leverage <2%, extreme values)

### 2021 Data Quality Concern
The sharp drop in DD during 2021 (5.36 vs 11.93 overall) warrants investigation:
- Check if specific banks/sectors driving the decline
- Verify data quality for 2021 daily returns
- Examine if regulatory changes affected calculations
- Consider if COVID recovery volatility impacted metrics
- **Recommendation**: Report results with and without 2021 for robustness

### Volatility Calculation
- Primary method (252-day): 89.3% of observations
- Partial year (90-179 days): 1.1%
- Peer median imputation: 9.7%
- All methods follow Bharath & Shumway (2008) timing discipline
