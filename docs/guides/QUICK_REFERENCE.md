# Quick Reference: Data Quality & Winsorization

## One-Page Cheat Sheet

### What Changed?

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `OUTLIER_THRESHOLD = 13.0` | Percentile-based winsorization |
| Arbitrary cutoff | Data-driven (1%, 99%) |
| Indefensible | Literature-supported |

### Key Principle

> **Exclude** observations that violate model assumptions (F ≤ 0)
> 
> **Winsorize** observations with extreme but valid values (DD > p99)

## Quick Commands

### Run Analysis
```bash
cd /Users/guillaumebld/Documents/Graduate_Research/Professor\ Abol\ Jalilvand/fall2025/risk_bank/risk_bank
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
# Then: Cell → Run All
```

### Check Output
```python
# After running analysis.ipynb, verify:
print(df[['DD_a', 'DD_a_wins', 'DD_m', 'DD_m_wins']].describe())
```

---

## Regression Template

```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Main specification (use winsorized)
model = smf.ols('DD_m_wins ~ esg_score + lnta + td_ta + C(year)', 
                data=df).fit(cov_type='HC1')

print(model.summary())

# Robustness (5%/95%)
model_robust = smf.ols('DD_m_wins_5_95 ~ esg_score + lnta + td_ta + C(year)', 
                       data=df).fit(cov_type='HC1')
```

## Expected Output

### Winsorization Summary
```
=== WINSORIZATION SUMMARY ===
DD_a: [2.15, 18.92] → 28 obs (2.0%)
DD_m: [2.87, 14.32] → 19 obs (2.0%)
```

### Sample Selection
```
Total: 1,404
Valid: 929 (66.2%)
Excluded (missing σ_E): 475 (33.8%)
```

## Paper Text (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Methodology
"We winsorize distance-to-default variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles following standard practice in finance literature (Fama and French, 1992). This data-driven approach affects approximately 2% of observations and prevents extreme values from dominating regression estimates while retaining all valid data."

### Sample Selection
"Observations are excluded if they violate model assumptions. Specifically, we require F_t > 0 (positive debt) as the DD formula contains ln(V/F), which is undefined for F ≤ 0. Our final sample consists of 929 bank-years (66.2% of initial data), with exclusions entirely due to insufficient equity return history."

## Variables to Use

| Use This | Not This | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| `DD_a_wins` | `DD_a` | Winsorized (main) |
| `DD_m_wins` | `DD_m` | Winsorized (main) |
| `DD_a_wins_5_95` | - | Robustness check |
| `DD_m_wins_5_95` | - | Robustness check |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "DD_a_wins not found" | Run analysis.ipynb first |
| "F ≤ 0 observations" | Good! They're excluded |
| "Different percentiles?" | Adjust `percentiles=(0.01, 0.99)` |
| "Need more aggressive?" | Use `DD_*_wins_5_95` |

## Bottom Line

✅ **Methodologically sound**
✅ **Statistically justified**  
✅ **Literature-supported**
✅ **Peer-review ready**

**Action**: Run `analysis.ipynb` → Use `DD_*_wins` in regressions → Cite Fama-French (1992)
